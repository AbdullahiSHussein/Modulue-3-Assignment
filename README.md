This assignment is a web scraper that takes text from Wikipedia and finds the most common word. I have cleaned the data to create a Markov chain. I took this website from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football . I worked with Python 3.11.4. The libraries that I used in this assignment were BeautifulSoup, NumPy, and NLTK. I have used the code from week 11 and 13 from NLP module from packham DAZ program. All of the text is from wikipedia which it can be edditted by the public. If i trained the chatbox, it will occor issue necause the data as i am using is pulbic.  I have found issue with the list of words from my web scaper  into a string so i have asked chatgpt for how to fix it and it have worked. One of the things that i canb imporve on is to create a large data set from muptile website and i would do that in web crawers.
